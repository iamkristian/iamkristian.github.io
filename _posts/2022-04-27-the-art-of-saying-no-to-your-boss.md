We've all been in a situation, where your boss wants you to stay after hours and fix some new burning issue, while he takes off to be with his family.

The reward of being a good worker bee is usually more work. - Never forget that.

So why is it we keep accepting this predicament? I think [@Brene Brown](https://twitter.com/brenebrown) said it best

> It takes courage to say **yes** to **_rest_** and **_play_** in a culture where exhaustion is seen as a status symbol

Pleasing, accepting, bending over and continuing to let go of your values with recharging, family, and not taking good care of yourself is the norm today.

If the people you work for cannot comprehend, you're not a machine. You need to show them. My philosophy is if your employer is committed to working with you, he also commits to respecting your wishes. Otherwise it is time to move on, or create your own business.

If I have been burning the midnight oil in a week I cannot produce the same the following weeks. I need to recharge. I need to play. Without play I loose my creative edge. I burn out and get more annoyed with my surroundings.

So lets follow by example of Brene Brown, and stop being exhausted.

\- and maybe, just maybe go play a little.
