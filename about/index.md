### HEY THERE!

# I'm Kristian

Dad, kayaker, writer, hacker and loads of other things. I'm pretty good at
walking too. Anyhow - I write and share code about ruby, elixir, UNIX
and cloud. On this site, I share all the stuff that's to technical for
other places. Mostly in English and Danish.
I earn a living writing code, facilitating as a Software Developer - Recently in finance, media and insurance. Now focusing on making the world a better place.

Oh yeah - that's me in the top photo - paddling in rough water. The wind is
about 10-12 m/s, the waves are between 1-2.5 meters. Great fun!
