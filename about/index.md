# About me

Hi! I'm Kristian. Hacker, dad, and writer. I write and share code about ruby
and elixir, and find search engines pretty facinating too!

This site mainly serves as a creative outlet for thoughts, learnings and
writings on various technical topics, mainly focused around
ruby, elixir, search, and unix. Occasionally I might throw a post on DIY
projects, or projects I'm currently focusing on.
