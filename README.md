# About

This is the repos for my personal site [krx.io](http://krx.io). It's built with Jekyll, and hosted on github using their github pages service.

## Configuration

I use scss to generate the krx.css file, so remember to do a

```bundle install```

before launching jekyll. If you want to change the krx.css run

```./script/watch-scss```

to recompile the css from scratch.
