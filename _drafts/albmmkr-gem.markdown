I've released the [albmmkr gem](https://github.com/iamkristian/albmmkr). A gem
that will help you organize your camera uploads, or any other arbitrary directory
full of images, if you're not using iphoto or other similar.

## What does it do?

It will sort your images based on the exif data.

I still need to write the binary executeble.
